Ongoing notes on development. Ideas for the future. Shit I am too lazy to do. Stuff like that.

On maps and mapper: just found that maps from screen (second largest magn) is roughly 65% of maps on file.
This is less than last time.
Automate this somehow?

On finding coords. What about a flashing light system? Could have coords on Tibia client, flash up a border of those,
    find that border in the webcam, and bobs your uncle! Can even calibrate the aberrations..
